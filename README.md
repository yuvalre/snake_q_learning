# Deep Q-Learning Agent For Snake

This project was the final project for a course in Advanced Practices In Machine Learning.
Each team implemented a custom reinforcement learning agent for Snake.
We implemented a deep Q-learning agent. Details on our implementation (including board state representation and network architecture) and explanation of our choices can be found in the [Project Description](https://github.com/yuvalre/snake_q_learning/blob/master/Project%20Description.pdf).

As a part of the grading, a tournament was held between all agents (with 5 opposing snakes in each game). Our agent was 4th out of 38.
